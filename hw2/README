Welcome to DREAMT:
Decoding, Reranking, Evaluation, and Alignment for Machine Translation

DREAMT will consist of four baseline components for the open-ended assignments
posted at mt-class.org:
1) The ALIGNER takes parallel texts and produces word alignments.
2) The DECODER takes source sentences and produce output translations.
3) The RERANKER takes output translations and produces a new ranking of them.
4) The EVALUATOR takes output translations and scores them against references.

At the moment, there is only the aligner and the decoder.
