There are three python programs here (-h for usage):
-align aligns words.
-check checks for out-of-bounds alignment points.
-grade computes alignment error rate.

The commands are designed to work in a pipeline. For instance, this is
a valid invocation:

> align -t 0.9 -n 1000 | check | grade -n 5

The data directory contains files derived from the Canadian Hansards,
originally aligned by Ulrich Germann:
-hansards.e English
-hansards.f French
-hansards.a alignments of the first 37 sentences. The notation
  i-j means the word as position i of the French is aligned
  to the word at position j of the English (zero-indexed);
  while notation i?j means they are probably aligned.
