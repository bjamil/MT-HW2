There are two python programs here (-h for usage):
-decode translates input sentences from French to English.
-grade computes the model score of a translated sentence.

These commands are designed to be used in a pipeline. So you can run:

> decode | grade

There is also a module:
-model.py implements very simple interfaces for language models
 and translation models, so you don't have to. 
It is quite possible to complete the assignment without modifying this
file at all. You might want to take a look at it to understand the
interface to the two models.

The data directory contains files derived from the Canadian Hansards,
originally aligned by Ulrich Germann:

-input: French sentences to translate.

-tm: a phrase-based translation model.
  French phrase ||| English phrase ||| log_10(translation_prob)

-lm: a trigram language model file in ARPA format:
  log_10(ngram_prob)   ngram   log_10(backoff_prob)

The language model and translation model are computed from the data 
in the align directory, using alignments from the Berkeley aligner.
